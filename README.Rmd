> __Model Performance and Stability Assessment Tools__ for Single Time Series, Panel Data, & Cross-Sectional Time Series Analysis


A `modeltime` extension that implements ___forecast resampling tools___ that assess __time-based model performance and stability__ for a single time series, panel data, and cross-sectional time series analysis.



```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/cross_validation_plan.jpg")
```

## Benefits: What Modeltime Resample Does

Resampling time series is an important strategy to __evaluate the stability of models over time.__ However, it's a pain to do this because it requires multiple for-loops to generate the predictions for multiple models and potentially multiple time series groups. __Modeltime Resample simplifies the iterative forecasting process taking the pain away.__

Modeltime Resample makes it easy to:

1. __Iteratively generate predictions__ from time series cross-validation plans.
2. __Evaluate the resample predictions__ to compare many time series models across multiple time-series windows.

Here is an example from [_Resampling Panel Data_](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.resample/articles/panel-data.html), where we can see that Prophet Boost and XGBoost Models outperform Prophet with Regressors for the Walmart Time Series Panel Dataset using the 6-Slice Time Series Cross Validation plan shown above. 

```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Model Accuracy for 6 Time Series Resamples"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/plotly_resample_error_plot.jpg")
```

```{r, echo=F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Resampled Model Accuracy (3 Models, 6 Resamples, 7 Time Series Groups)"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/gt_accuracy_table.jpg")
```
