> __Model Performance and Stability Assessment Tools__ for Single Time Series, Panel Data, & Cross-Sectional Time Series Analysis


A `modeltime` extension that implements ___forecast resampling tools___ that assess __time-based model performance and stability__ for a single time series, panel data, and cross-sectional time series analysis.



```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/cross_validation_plan.jpg")
```

## Installation

CRAN version:

``` r
install.packages("modeltime.resample")
```

Development version (latest features):

``` r
remotes::install_github("business-science/modeltime.resample")
```

## Why Modeltime Resample?

Resampling time series is an important strategy to __evaluate the stability of models over time.__ However, it's a pain to do this because it requires multiple for-loops to generate the predictions for multiple models and potentially multiple time series groups. __Modeltime Resample simplifies the iterative forecasting process taking the pain away.__

Modeltime Resample makes it easy to:

1. __Iteratively generate predictions__ from time series cross-validation plans.
2. __Evaluate the resample predictions__ to compare many time series models across multiple time-series windows.

Here is an example from [_Resampling Panel Data_](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.resample/articles/panel-data.html), where we can see that Prophet Boost and XGBoost Models outperform Prophet with Regressors for the Walmart Time Series Panel Dataset using the 6-Slice Time Series Cross Validation plan shown above. 

```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Model Accuracy for 6 Time Series Resamples"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/plotly_resample_error_plot.jpg")
```

```{r, echo=F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Resampled Model Accuracy (3 Models, 6 Resamples, 7 Time Series Groups)"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/gt_accuracy_table.jpg")
```

### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. __Businesses now need 10,000+ time series forecasts every day.__ This is what I call a _High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)_ - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable Forecasting. 

 __High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies by improving accuracy and scalability.__ Imagine what will happen to your career if you can provide your organization a "High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System" (HPTSF System).

### How to Learn High-Performance Time Series Forecasting

I teach how to build a HPTFS System in my [__High-Performance Time Series Forecasting Course__](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting). You will learn:

- __Time Series Machine Learning__ (cutting-edge) with `Modeltime` - 30+ Models (Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest, & many more)
- __Deep Learning__ with `GluonTS` (Competition Winners)
- __Time Series Preprocessing__, Noise Reduction, & Anomaly Detection
- __Feature engineering__ using lagged variables & external regressors
- __Hyperparameter Tuning__
- __Time series cross-validation__
- __Ensembling__ Multiple Machine Learning & Univariate Modeling Techniques (Competition Winner)
- __Scalable Forecasting__ - Forecast 1000+ time series in parallel
- and more.
