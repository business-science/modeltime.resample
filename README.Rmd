> Resampling Tools for Time Series Forecasting with Modeltime


A `modeltime` extension that implements ___time series resampling tools___ for making iterative predictions and evaluating resample results.

## Benefits: What Modeltime Resample Does

Resampling time series is an important strategy to evaluate models across multiple time series windows. However, it's a pain to do this because it requires multiple for-loops to generate the predictions for multiple models. __Modeltime Resample simplifies the iterative forecasting process taking the pain away.__

Modeltime Resample makes it easy to:

1. __Iteratively generate predictions__ from time series cross-validation plans.
2. __Evaluate the resample predictions__ to compare many time series models across multiple time-series windows.

## Installation

Install the CRAN version:

``` r
# Not on CRAN yet
# install.packages("modeltime.resample")
```

Or, install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("business-science/modeltime.resample")
```

## Getting Started

1. [Getting Started with Modeltime](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime.html): Learn the basics of forecasting with Modeltime. 
2. [Getting Started with Modeltime Resample](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.resample/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime-resample.html): Learn the basics of time series resample evaluation. 


 

## Evaluate Your Time Series Resamples in Minutes

Load the Following Libraries. 

```{r}
library(modeltime)
library(modeltime.resample)
library(timetk)
```

### Step 1 - Make a Cross-Validation Training Plan

Use functions from `rsample` or `timetk` to produce an `rset`. The `m750_training_resamples` was made with `timetk::time_series_cv()`.

```{r}
# Begin with a Cross Validation Strategy
m750_training_resamples %>%
    tk_time_series_cv_plan() %>%
    plot_time_series_cv_plan(date, value, .facet_ncol = 2, .interactive = FALSE)
```

### Step 2 - Make a Modeltime Table

Create models and add them to a _Modeltime Table_ with [__Modeltime.__](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime.html)

```{r}
m750_models
```


### Step 3 - Generate Resample Predictions

Generate resample predictions using `modeltime_fit_resamples()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
m750_training_resamples_fitted <- m750_models %>%
    modeltime_fit_resamples(
        resamples = m750_training_resamples,
        control   = control_resamples(verbose = T)
    )
```

### Step 4 - Evaluate the Results

Evaluate the results with `modeltime_resample_accuracy()`.

```{r, eval=F}
m750_training_resamples_fitted %>%
    modeltime_resample_accuracy(summary_fns = mean) %>%
    table_modeltime_accuracy(.interactive = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=F, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/gt_accuracy_table.png")
```
